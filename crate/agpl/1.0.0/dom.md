documentation: "This is the root hierarchy of the DOM packages.\nDOM is a standard API to interface to XML trees. It is divided into\nseveral main parts (Core, Events, ...).\nNote that to be fully compliant, strings must be UTF-16 encoded. However,\nyou still have the choice in this implementation, so that you can use\nUTF-8 encoding for documents that only have ASCII characters (and thus save\nsome space in memory).\nThis encoding is in the file xml/encodings.ads\n\nThe comments in these packages are not meant as a tutorial, or even a\nreference documentation for DOM. Please see the official XML\ndocumentation.",
